It is an essential tool for web application post exploitation, and could be used like a backdoor or as a stealth access to manage web accounts, even if hosted in free hosting services.

Main features: \r\n\r\n* Backdoor communications are hidden in Cookie requests\r\n* Communications are encoded using NIDS evasion techniques (any request is randomly obfuscated to bypass signature detection)\r\n* Backdoor PHP code is polymorphic to obfuscate functions commonly used in backdoors\r\n* Modular architecture have about 30 modules for every kind of maintain access/post exploit task\r\n* Modules implement different techniques to accomplish single tasks to mitigate disabled_functions, safe_mode and other PHP restrictions","tagline":"Stealth tiny web shell","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
